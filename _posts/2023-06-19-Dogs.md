# Dogs

Where do I begin? We got Kiwi, early January of 2021. After having done a lot of research on the breed I wanted, I concluded that I wanted a small dog, cudly and playful with a bit of a personality. Bichon Frise first in my shortlist, but those little cottony fur balls somehow gave way to a breed called Havanese. Little did I know at that point a chocolate brown havanese will come into my life and change my life forever. My notion of owning a dog had been fed from what I have heard from hearsay and seen on TVs and ofcourse the numerous reels on Instagram. I have never been close to anyone who has owned a dog. It is pretty un-common to have pets in India back when I was growing up. Growing up as a boy, watching american TV shows , getting a dog was a fantasy i always wanted to fulfill not fully knowing what it might really mean.

End of December 2020 I got a call from a breeder that they have a puppy who might be a good fit for us. We were not ready. We had not planned on getting a puppy in 1 week. Someone who was going to get this dog had backed out and we were notified last minute. We decided to give it a go. I remember handing the breeder the cash and getting the dog along with a few things like a blanket smelling of his litter and a few toys. He was confused and lost for the first few days, so were we. First few months were hard, incredibly hard. Training him to pee and poop outside, taking him for his first walk after vaccinations, socializing him were some of the unforgettable memories we made growing up a puppy. He was a scared little pupper and was anxious to go close to other dogs but early puppy socialization helped him overcome this fear and enjoy quality play time with his kind. Thanks to the book called [The Art of Raising a Puppy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32218.The_Art_of_Raising_a_Puppy?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=PL6WDlfu8n&rank=1) we had some knowhow of the things we needed to do make him a well adjusted dog. 


It took me some time to learn to communicate with my dog and understand him. It is hard to fall back to communicating with primitive gestures and body language when you are used to doing this with words. I think I am able to get him about 70% of the times, rest 30% is still in progress. However I think I have the basics down. Food, water, outside, play and cuddle. Sometimes he wants me to open the door so he can go sleep in the loft or go see Mommy, these subtle ones are hard and are a hit and miss right now. I do realize that he has his own desires and doesn't always have to just stick around me/us. As he is getting older I can see how is calming down and is being less stubborn about things and just being handing out by himself. 

Dogs are incredible creatures and get truly bonded to their owners. When i play rough with him and topple him fighting him, i know that he trusts me enough that i will never hurt him. He will willfully expose his belly and giggle for me to give him belly rubs. As a matter of fact even when i unintentionally hurt him like accidentally stepping on his tail, he will come lick me almost to tell me that I know you didn't do it on purpose. I know he gets it why i brush his teeth but hates it nevertheless. One thing that I think every dog owner will admit to learning from there dog is patience. When we have long days at work and are not able to spend as much time with him, he will patiently wait for us to get free only to throw the toy or go for a walk. He is the happiest when all 3 of us go out together exploring a new park. You can literally see him smiling and with wind in his legs walking with his pack with his, with his mouth wide open and tongue flopping around. 


It is going to be almost 3 years and I will admit we have had doubts. As a matter of fact, it turns out my wife has allergy to dogs but the thought of ever giving him away has never crossed our minds. ( I will admit early on during his puppy days, we have had thoughts of returning him, because it was hard, but not anymore). He has given us more than we could've ever asked for. He has licked our tears and comforted us in moments of anxiety and tension. Every time I scream because Man United concede, I know a fellow red devil will come lick my face and calm me down. I know that he has got my back no matter what happens and I promise you little kiddo i have got yours. I will chase all those rabbits and especially those crows away from the face of the earth with you until eternity.
