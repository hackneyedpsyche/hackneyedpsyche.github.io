This is my attempt to retain the most out of reading books. I love reading books on random topics. I realize that sometimes in an attempt to read as many books as possible and get to a number for the year, i compromise on the amount of information i can retain from a book. Hence I will attempt to summarize every book i read as i go along, so I can retain from it as much as I can and hopefully share with others if they so desire to read summaries and jists of some of the books i've read.
