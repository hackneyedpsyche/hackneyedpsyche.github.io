This is my personal blog. The topics will vary ranging from somewhat personal things to book summaries. I love reading books on random topics, specially non-fiction fact driven books like the one I most recently read [Chip War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321447-chip-war?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_9). I realize that sometimes in an attempt to read as many books as possible and get to a number for the year, I compromise on the amount of information I can retain from a book. This kinda makes the process of reading academic but I do desire to retain interesting anecdotes and facts from every book I read. Hence I will attempt to summarize every book I read as I go along, so I can retain from it as much as I can and hopefully share with others if they so desire to read summaries of some of the books I've read. In addition I will sometimes write about personal discoveries, some new technology and sometimes about truly random topics I cannot foresee at this point.
